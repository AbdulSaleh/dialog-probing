# Way Off-Policy Batch Deep Reinforcement Learning of Implicit Human Preferences in Dialog

This code supports training conversational dialog models from a static batch of data (with no exploration) using Q-learning and KL-control, as described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00456). The main file is ```way_off_policy_batch_rl.py```, which is invoked using ```run_rl.py```. Using a pre-trained model checkpoint, and a .csv file of interaction data, the file samples batches of data from a replay buffer and trains with respect to the Q-learning loss. Several enhancements enable better learning:
  * KL-control to penalize divergence from the pre-trained prior.
  * Psi-learning, which uses a logsumexp instead of a max over the estimated future reward. Equivalent to entropy maximization and important for generating diverse samples.
  * Model averging, which allows you to use an aggregated prior computed by averaging the predictions of several models. This can be pre-computed using ```model_averaging.py```
  * Monte-carlo Target Q-value estimation, in which dropout is used to get a lower bound of the Target Q-value.

These options can be toggled using the hyperparameter settings in ```run_rl.py```. We also include code for a discrete version of [Batch Constrained Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02900) in ```dbcq.py```.

Interaction data was collected using http://neural.chat. To deploy your own model on the web, please see the related repo https://github.com/asmadotgh/neural_chat_web.

## Prerequisites
See the top level README for libraries and installation instructions. You will need to make sure Infersent, TorchMoji, and the Google News Vectors are all installed and downloaded in order to compute the existing rewards.

## Data format
The raw batch of interaction data is provided as a .csv with columns for the actions and user response. The names of the columns are specified at the top of the file, and can be changed to suit your data. After preprocessing, the model saves the cleaned, tokenized inputs into the columns *state*, *action*, *next_state*, and *done*.

### Extracting rewards
In our case, we use the human responses to extract different reward functions using the file ```rewards.py```. Each reward function is added as a column to the .csv file, and all reward columns start with the prefix 'reward_'. To preprocess and compute rewards, use:

```
python BatchRL/rewards.py --raw --experience_path=<path_to_experience_csv_file> --save_path=<save_path>
```

## Training
Once you've computed the rewards, you can train the RL model using the processed .csv and your pretrained checkpoint. Be sure to specify which reward columns to use and how much to weight each column, as follows:

```
python BatchRL/run_rl.py --checkpoint=<path_to_your_checkpoint_directory> --experience_path=<path_to_processed_csv> \
    -r 'reward_deepmoji' 'reward_answer_length_words' -w 0.5 0.5
```

The file ```run_rl.py``` shows how to add hyperparameters for KL-control, etc. The best performing model uses KL-control with Psi-learning and monte carlo targets, as follows:

```
python BatchRL/run_rl.py --checkpoint=<path_to_your_checkpoint_directory> --experience_path=<path_to_processed_csv> \
    -r 'reward_deepmoji' 'reward_answer_length_words' -w 0.5 0.5 \
    --monte_carlo_count=5 --kl_control --kl_weight_c 0.5 --psi_learning
```

## Interacting with RL Models

Use the following command to interact with / talk to a saved model checkpoint:
```
python model/interact.py --debug --load_rl_ckpt --checkpoint=<path_to_your_checkpoint_directory>
```
